# Git challenge

## Part 2

In this lesson we've seen how to undo changes / commits so we will now do some exercises to test these new skills.

**Please answer all the questions in the `README.md` of your project below each of them.**

1.  Fork this [repository](https://github.com/dualboot-partners/git-challenge-part2)

2.  Create a new branch `feature-a`

    a. Create a commit updating the user's personal data with your own data. `(commit 1)`

    b. Create another commit updating the text of the footer. `(commit 2)`

    c. Undo your last commit. What command would you use and why?

    d. Push your changes.

3.  a. Change anything from `index.html` and commit. `(commit 3)`

    b. Change another thing from index.html and commit. `(commit 4)`

    c. You have realized that you introduced a bug with your `commit 1` so you want to undo the entire commit. What command would you use and why?

4.  a. Change anything from `index.html` and commit. `(commit 5)`

    b. After examining your previous commit, you realized you made a typo in one word so you want to undo your last commit without losing the changes, fix the typo and re commit. What command would you use and why?

5.  Push everything and merge your branch to `main`.

6.  Now you need to undo your `commit 2`. Remember that all your previous commits are now part of the `main` branch which is shared with all your coworkers so you should be aware of the command you will use here. What command would you use and why?
